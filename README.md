# (Fuel-Econ Dataset)
## by (Kevin Kamanja)


## Fuel-econ Dataset

> The dataset has a total of 3929 entries with 20 columns. The dataset was obtained from the datasets within the course outline. Data Wrangling involved looking for missing values in the dataset, presence of duplicate rows, datatypes of various entries and checking whether the format of the datatypes is correct. 

> The main features of investigation included VClass,Engine size(displ), year, co2(co2 emissions) and combined fuel efficiency(comb). 


## Summary of Findings

> The data was explored in three phases: Univariate, Bivariate and MultiVariate.

### Univariate

> A total of seven plots were plottted and they included donut plot and histograms. These plots looked at individual variables in the dataset. This showed distribution of the variables in the dataset, from normal to uniform to distributions skewed to the right. There were various variables with outliers in their visualizations such as transmission type(trans), fuel_type, drive, make and combustion(comb) variables.

### Bivariate

> A total of 6 plots were plotted here. They included boxplots, violin plots and regression plots. Jitter was also added to some plots for further clarity and understanding of the data. The purpose of the plots was to show the relationship between combined fuel effficiency and other variables such as engine size and co2 emissions to show fuel efficiency. Combined fuel efficiency was seen to have  a high correlation with co2 emission. As more fuel is burnt, more co2 emission occurs. Fuel efficiency and fuel displacement are highly corrlated. As fuel is diplaced, it is combusted in the same proportion

### Multivariate

> A total of seven plots were plotted here to show the relationships between three variables. Plots included scatter plots, histograms and facets to look at the relationship between various variables.Investigation of fuel efficiency against fuel combustion in this section was further looked into by looking at the impact of the three features. The multivariate exploration showed that there is a relationship between the amount of fuel displaced , combined fuel efficiency and co2 emissions. 

> 11 visualizations will be brought into the explanatory presentation where their meanings and distributions will be illustrated.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The presentation will try to bring out how the variables in the datatset contribute to fuel efficiency. Among other explorations, the dataset will look at how engine size and co2 emissions contribute to fuel efficiency. Their relationships will be displayed and explained in the slideshow.
